                <p>Myroslava Kotorovych was born in Kyiv in a family of musicians: the outstanding violinist Bohodar Kotorovych and harpist Natalia Kmet. She graduated from Kyiv Specialized Secondary Music boarding school named after M. V. Lysenko, the National Music Academy of Ukraine . Myroslava considers her ten-year concert activity as a member of Gidon Kremer's chamber orchestra "Kremerata Baltica" to be her "practical European conservatory". At the same time, for twelve years she was a soloist and concertmaster, as well as deputy director for creative issues of the National Chamber Ensemble "Kyiv Soloists". 
In 2013, in an effort to share her own performing experience, Myroslava united young talented musicians into the Creative Workshop - Chamber Ensemble ARTEHATTA.
